React Native Web + CSS Grid
==============

An app created to see how well React Native Web and CSS Grid played together and determine a strategy for implementing in Launchpad-UI.

TODO
----

- Use JSONata for Statistics component.
- Outer grid gaps causing multiple widgets to overflow out of workspace.
- Make the IOS and Android files
- Fix deleteWidget/editWidget functions. Method of setting state probably needs work.
- Code Cleanup - Remove redundant code
